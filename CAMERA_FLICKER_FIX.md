# Camera Flicker Fix - Technical Explanation

## Problem Identified

The webcam stream was flickering/re-initializing repeatedly due to **unstable callback references** being passed to the `CameraFeed` component.

### Root Causes:

1. **`onFrame` callback recreation**: Created inline on every render
2. **`_attachVideoRef` callback recreation**: Created inline with arrow function `(el) => (videoRef.current = el)`
3. **`captureFrame` function recreation**: Recreated on every state change

## How CameraFeed Works

The `CameraFeed` component has a `useEffect` that depends on several props:
```typescript
useEffect(() => {
  // Initialize camera stream
  // ...
}, [deviceId, facingMode, width, height, onFrame, showOverlay, landmarks]);
```

**Critical Issue**: When `onFrame` or `_attachVideoRef` changed on every render, the entire `useEffect` re-ran, causing:
- Camera stream to stop
- getUserMedia() to be called again
- New stream to start
- Visual flicker/blink in the video feed

## Solution Applied

### 1. Added `useCallback` import
```typescript
import { useEffect, useMemo, useRef, useState, useCallback } from "react";
```

### 2. Wrapped `onFrame` in `useCallback`
**Before:**
```typescript
const onFrame = () => {
  // TODO: ML processing
};
```

**After:**
```typescript
const onFrame = useCallback(() => {
  // TODO: ML processing
}, []); // Empty deps - function doesn't need to change
```

### 3. Wrapped `attachVideoRef` in `useCallback`
**Before:**
```typescript
<CameraFeed
  _attachVideoRef={(el) => (videoRef.current = el)}
/>
```

**After:**
```typescript
const attachVideoRef = useCallback((el: HTMLVideoElement | null) => {
  videoRef.current = el;
}, []);

<CameraFeed
  _attachVideoRef={attachVideoRef}
/>
```

### 4. Wrapped `captureFrame` in `useCallback`
**Before:**
```typescript
const captureFrame = (): string | null => {
  if (!videoRef.current) return null;
  // ...
};
```

**After:**
```typescript
const captureFrame = useCallback((): string | null => {
  if (!videoRef.current) return null;
  // ...
}, []); // Only depends on ref which doesn't change
```

### 5. Wrapped `toggleRecording` in `useCallback`
**Before:**
```typescript
const toggleRecording = async () => {
  // Recording logic
};
```

**After:**
```typescript
const toggleRecording = useCallback(async () => {
  // Recording logic
}, [isRecording, capturedFrames, captureFrame]);
```

## Why This Works

### React's Rendering Behavior:
1. When state changes (e.g., `setOutput()`), component re-renders
2. All functions are recreated with new references
3. Props with new references trigger child component effects
4. `CameraFeed`'s `useEffect` sees new `onFrame` reference
5. Effect cleanup runs → camera stops
6. Effect runs again → camera restarts
7. **Result**: Flicker

### With `useCallback`:
1. State changes, component re-renders
2. `useCallback` returns **same function reference** (memoized)
3. Props maintain stable references
4. `CameraFeed`'s `useEffect` sees **same** `onFrame` reference
5. Effect doesn't re-run unnecessarily
6. Camera stream stays stable
7. **Result**: Smooth video

## Performance Benefits

### Before Fix:
- Camera reinitialized on **every state change**
- getUserMedia() called repeatedly
- Stream stopped/started causing visual glitches
- Higher CPU usage from constant stream reinit

### After Fix:
- Camera initialized **once** when component mounts
- Only reinitializes when `deviceId` actually changes
- Smooth, stable video feed
- Lower CPU usage

## Testing Checklist

- [ ] Camera starts smoothly without flicker
- [ ] Switching between Local/Cloud models doesn't restart camera
- [ ] Recording frames doesn't cause video to blink
- [ ] Frame counter updates smoothly during recording
- [ ] Stopping recording doesn't restart camera
- [ ] Showing/hiding feedback doesn't affect camera
- [ ] Changing camera device in dropdown properly switches
- [ ] No console errors about MediaStream

## Additional Notes

### Why Empty Dependency Arrays?

**`onFrame` - `[]`:**
- Doesn't use any state/props
- Just a placeholder for future ML integration
- No need to recreate

**`attachVideoRef` - `[]`:**
- Only updates a ref (mutable object)
- Refs don't trigger re-renders
- Safe to keep stable

**`captureFrame` - `[]`:**
- Only accesses `videoRef.current` (ref)
- Refs maintain stable reference across renders
- Safe to keep stable

**`toggleRecording` - `[isRecording, capturedFrames, captureFrame]`:**
- Needs current `isRecording` state for branching logic
- Needs `capturedFrames` to check length
- Needs `captureFrame` to call during recording
- Must update when these change

## Future Optimization Opportunities

1. **Memoize CameraFeed entirely**
   ```typescript
   const MemoizedCameraFeed = React.memo(CameraFeed);
   ```

2. **Use refs for frame counter** (avoid state updates)
   ```typescript
   const frameCountRef = useRef(0);
   // Update ref instead of state during recording
   ```

3. **Debounce output updates** during recording
   ```typescript
   const debouncedSetOutput = useMemo(
     () => debounce(setOutput, 100),
     []
   );
   ```
